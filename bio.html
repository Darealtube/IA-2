        <h3>
          Apium graveolens L., commonly known as Celery, is a vegetable from the
          Family Apiaceae. It is an annual perennial plant that grows throughout
          Europe as well as the tropical and the subtropical regions of Asia and
          Africa and is cultivated worldwide. Celery has a complex structure
          containing stems, leaves, and thick roots. It is typically grown in
          nutritious soil that has been fertilized with compost and well-rotted
          manure. Moreover, it requires consistent moisture to grow ideally.
          Celery is often characterized with its erect biennial or perennial
          herb and the distinct smell of celery. Its height ranges up to 1 meter
          and above. The stem has prominent rather coarse grooves, rising from a
          large fleshy taproot. Celery has compound leaves, made up of two or
          more discrete leaflets. The lower leaves have a pinnate arrangement,
          usually 10-14 centimeters long with deltate-rhomboid segments scaling
          up to 4-5 cm. It is commonly used as an ingredient in human food and
          beverages. Furthermore, it is often utilized as an anthelmintic,
          antispasmodic, carminative, diuretic, laxative, and a sedative
          stimulant in traditional medicine

          Coleus blancoi Benth., commonly known as Mayana or Coleus, is a
          species of flowering plant belonging to the Family Lamiaceae. It is
          commonly found in areas with tropical climates, in which its native
          range is tropical and subtropical Asia to northern Australia. Mayana
          plants are usually grown for its leaves, not for the flowers. It
          thrives in rich, well-drained soil as well as in heat, the kind of
          environment that promotes rapid growth. The plant has a complex
          structure containing stems, leaves, and thick roots. It is a woody
          angiosperm with opposite compound leaves. Mayana or Coleus is usually
          characterized with its branched, fleshy, annual herb about 1 meter
          high. Both the stems and the flowers are purplish. The flowers are
          numerous and 15 to 30 centimeters long, borne in lax, terminal,
          simple, or branched inflorescences. The leaves, which is the most
          noticeable asset of Mayana, are variously blotched or colored; with
          the colors usually ranging from uniformly velvety-purple, yellow,
          pink, intense red, and luminous chartreuse. Moreover, its leaves are
          usually ovulate, rather coarsely toothed, more or less hairy, and are
          5 to 10 centimeters long. Mayana or Coleus plants are generally used
          in folkloric medicine in which it is a natural analgesic, primarily
          used for pain, soreness, swelling, and cuts. It can also be an adjunct
          medication for delayed menstruation and diarrhea. However, for non
          medicinal purposes, it is typically displayed as an ornamental plant.

          Alugbati or Malabar Spinach (Basella alba L.) is an edible perennial
          vine that belongs to the Family Basellaceae. It is often found in
          tropical Asia, Africa, and Malaya, where it is largely cultivated as a
          vegetable. The plant is also native to the Indian subcontinent,
          Southeast Asia, and New Guinea. The ideal environment for the growth
          of alugbati is in soils high in organic matter. Moreover, the soil
          must be retained moist and loamy in order to produce the best state of
          alugbati. Alugbati is generally a smooth, twining herbaceous vine that
          can grow up to several meters in length. It is often characterized by
          its purplish or green stems as well as its somewhat fleshy leaves. The
