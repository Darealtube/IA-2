        Maroyaka offers a unique touch to the classic snack go-to of the people.
        Desserts such as cupcakes, cheesecakes, graham balls, and cookies can
        blissfully satisfy target potential customers’ cravings by providing
        them easy access to these sweet delicacies that can be bought at a fair
        price. Most Filipinos have a sweet tooth and at most family gatherings,
        sweet delicacies must be on the table. Data based on Filipinos’ Google
        searches showed that since the pandemic started in the country,
        Filipinos’ sweet cravings have intensified. One reason is that the
        pandemic has limited people’s outdoor activities in which they couldn’t
        buy foods that they want to eat unless they have stocks in their house.
        This heightened interest in sweets and pastries among Filipinos led to
        an increase in the number of food trends and the number of people
        resorting to online selling which includes baked goods.
        <br /><br />
        Many entrepreneurs including the younger ones have imparted their baking
        skills and experiences to make money from their passion. However, some
        of these entrepreneurs are not able to meet such customers’ demands due
        to their products’ price and quality. In accordance with this, young
        entrepreneurs at Pasig City Science High School came up with the idea of
        opening a small business in which they can use their passion and skills
        for baking in carefully and delightedly crafts luscious pastries and
        cakes. Our primary strategy is to focus on utilizing social media reach
        on different platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok.
        The continuous increase in popularity of different social media
        platforms can be the right way to promote the starting small business of
        Sucre Jar Company. Maroyaka. Through social media platforms, target
        potential customers could turn into buyers by means of sharing updates,
        reviews, and other relevant information related to product offerings.
        Moreover, sending news and updates through email addresses customer
        provides will be one of the marketing strategies the company is planning
        to utilize. A web page will be used as well to host ordering and buying
        our products online. Customers have an option to pick up their orders or
        have it delivered to the comfort of their homes through their preferred
        courier including the Grab Express, Lalamove, and Mr. Speedy.
        <br /><br />
        Overall, Maroyaka has a number of competitive features and the fact that
        we offer a unique touch to the classic snack go-to of the people. Also,
        the recipe is crafted to fit the general likings of the masses by still
        being able to show the character of the company through the taste and
        aesthetics. Lastly, Maroyaka offers a significant price decrease while
        maintaining and surpassing the qualities of a good product through the
        efficient use of the materials and ingredients the company wields.
